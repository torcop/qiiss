Dear,

Thanks you very much for your quick answer by message to this number : 0420 380 893.

Here is the answers to yours questions:

1/ To build an online business website I use Symfony2 Framework (http://symfony.com/) as a professionnal and robust tool for web-development. All my created website are based on a Model-View-Control pattern (MVC) to keep the code clean and easily manageable for the others developers. I also use Twig template (http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) to render each view of the website (The PHP and HTML/CSS code is totally seperated). To persist the data and manage the database, I use Doctrine2 wich is a good Object Relationnal Mapped (ORM) tool. All this tools are the latest technology in the web-development and insure a real security for your web application. I don't like to reinvent the wheel, there's a lot of JQuery/Javascript plugins and script wich allows you to add some professionnal stuff like an image slider for advertisement, animated menu, user notification and professionnal user interface. When i'm building a new website for a customer i've an accurate proccess : Firstly I understand or write the specification of the project, after I start to create the essential functionnality like login session, register form, checkout system. The design integration with HTML/CSS comes after. Before to send my hole work, I use to test the security of my code with tool like Selenium IDE (http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/) wich create different scenario and show you if there's a problem with you code or not. I have a coding style, it mean no more than 25 lines per function (if possible), comment my code for the next developers and keep a good indentation of the code. When the website is online, I work with the SEO part, it means to improve the ranking of the website by dealing with the metadata inside each HTML page or use others technics like backlinking, indexation, robot.txt, optimisation, etc. I also like to work on Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Facebook to expand the website. I also know to use some e-commerce tools like OS-commerce, Magento and Prestashop wich is my favorite one today.

2/ - Tripnco.com is created with Symfony2, I developped the hole website with one other developer.
	 - Twenga.com : Coded only with PHP/Mysql/HTML/CSS, This website is the first search engine to compare the prices of the products in 		    France.
   - 1001remises.com : Any development, I've worked to add all the products in the backoffice, manage each advertisement, work with Google 		 Analytics, Google Adwords and SEO.
	 - vente-unique.com
